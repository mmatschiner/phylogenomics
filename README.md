# Phylogenomics

A collection of tutorials covered in the LMU Munich Phylogenomics course.

## Prepration

* [Requirements](requirements/README.md)<br>A list of all installations required for the tutorials

* [Getting Started](getting_started/README.md)<br>General instructions on the use of these tutorials

## Day 1

* [Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenetic Inference](ml_phylogeny_inference/README.md)<br>A tutorial on maximum-likelihhood phylogenetic inference

* [Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference](bayesian_phylogeny_inference/README.md)<br>A tutorial on Bayesian inference of time-calibrated phylogenies

<!-- XXX This may be optional XXX
* [Phylogenetic Divergence-Time Estimation](divergence_time_estimation/README.md)<br>A tutorial on phylogenetic divergence-time estimation with with fossils
-->

* [Maximum-Likelihood Species-Tree Inference](ml_species_tree_inference/README.md)<br>A tutorial on maximum-likelihood species-tree inference based on gene trees

## Day 2

* [Bayesian Species-Tree Inference](bayesian_species_tree_inference/README.md)<br>A tutorial on Bayesian inference of time-calibrated species trees

<!-- XXX This needs to wait until Cactus is installed XXX
* [Whole-Genome Alignment](whole_genome_alignment/README.md)<br>A tutorial on repeat masking and whole-genome alignment of assembled genomes
-->

## Day 3

* [Species-Tree Inference with SNP Data](species_tree_inference_with_snp_data/README.md)<br>A tutorial on the inference of species trees from SNP data based on quartets

* [Divergence-Time Estimation with SNP Data](divergence_time_estimation_with_snp_data/README.md)<br>A tutorial on Bayesian divergence-time estimation with SNP data

<!--
* [Maximum-Likelihood Inference of Species Networks](ml_inference_of_species_networks/README.md)<br>A tutorial on maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference of species networks

* [Bayesian Inference of Species Networks](bayesian_inference_of_species_networks/README.md)<br>A tutorial on Bayesian phylogenetic inference of species networks

#### Thursday

* [Analysis of Introgression with SNP Data](analysis_of_introgression_with_snp_data/README.md)<br>A tutorial on the analysis of hybridization and introgression with SNP data

* [Analysis of Introgression with Tree Topologies](analysis_of_introgression_with_tree_topologies/README.md)<br>A tutorial on the analysis of hybridization and introgression with tree topologies from across the genome.

#### Friday

* [Inference from Simulated Data](inference_from_simulated_data/README.md)<br>A tutorial on coalescent simulations of genomic data and inferences from simulated data


## Exam

* The [Inference from Simulated Data](inference_from_simulated_data/README.md) on Friday of the second week will also serve as our examination for this course as different analyses throughout the course have to be recapitulated by the student using simulated data instead of empirical ones. Hence, the different causes are known. The final part will be that the students have to present their results at the end for passing the course.
